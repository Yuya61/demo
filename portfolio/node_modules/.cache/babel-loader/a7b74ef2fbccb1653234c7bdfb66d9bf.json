In the early days,\n            my primary process of an idea in order to proceed with this project\n            was to create several web design prototypes for building a website.\n            So that we needed to take several meetings to work smoothly and\n            facilitate communication. and to find the right problems I asked\n            myself what the previous site does intentionally or how service am I\n            building? I approached this project from these things.\n          </VectorP>\n          <VectorH1 style={{ marginTop: \"5rem\" }}>My role</VectorH1>\n          <VectorP>\n            I worked on multiple projects related to Vector as a UI/UX designer\n            together with the development team, including the main site and\n            brochure. In addition to those, I gave input regarding the as an\n            adviser for new contents.\n          </VectorP>\n          <VectorGridHalf>\n            <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n              <ImageGrid\n                style={{ maxWidth: \"100%\" }}\n                src={VectorArticle_3}\n                id=\"\"\n              />\n            </div>\n            <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n              <ImageGrid\n                style={{ maxWidth: \"100%\" }}\n                src={VectorArticle_4}\n                id=\"\"\n              />\n            </div>\n          </VectorGridHalf>\n          <VectorCaption style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n            The prototype that was first proposed to the client.\n          </VectorCaption>\n          <VectorH1>Challenge</VectorH1>\n          <VectorP>\n            The big challenge the client had was how to build an accessible way\n            to reach the contents of testimonials or significant sections else\n            easily, and create an intriguing website even more powerful. After\n            several meetings, I heard about the challenges of this project and\n            the concept of the most useful site that the client feels, and then\n            proposed the above prototype.\n          </VectorP>\n          <VectorGridHalf>\n            <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n              <ImageGrid\n                style={{ maxWidth: \"100%\" }}\n                src={VectorArticle_5}\n                id=\"\"\n              />\n            </div>\n            <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n              <ImageGrid\n                style={{ maxWidth: \"100%\" }}\n                src={VectorArticle_6}\n                id=\"\"\n              />\n            </div>\n          </VectorGridHalf>\n          <VectorCaption\n            style={{ textAlign: \"center\", marginBottom: \"2.5rem\" }}\n          >\n            The client suggested load the video when LapTop boot up.\n          </VectorCaption>\n          <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\", marginBottom: \"0.5rem\" }}>\n            <Image style={{ margin: \"0\" }} src={VectorArticle_7} id=\"\" />\n          </div>\n          <VectorCaption style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n            Finalized top page design promoting the vector and its feature.\n          </VectorCaption>\n          <VectorH1>Solution</VectorH1>\n          <VectorP>\n            Great emphasis was placed on content unification and adaptability to\n            the individual needs of customers. And how to incorporate dynamic\n            content such as slides that were not on the previous site. We wanted\n            to provide a smooth experience for customers who even not aim to be\n            students or who weren't very frequent. The content on this site is\n            designed to make it easy for all customer groups to find relevant\n            information.\n          </VectorP>\n          <VectorH1 style={{ marginTop: \"5rem\" }}>Final thoughts</VectorH1>\n          <VectorP>\n            I think that the depth of involvement of designers and developers in\n            the project by the time it is completed will change depending on the\n            budget and period. What I thought about this project was to deeply\n            research the extensibility of the project. In fact, after the top\n            page was completed, the client's intentions changed and the content\n            increased. When that happens, it becomes difficult to modify the\n            work that has already been completed. For this project, where the\n            challenge was to have a consistent design, it was essential to have\n            adaptability to it. It was a great experience a project that\n            reminded me of what significance to search to find out the client's\n            core intention.\n          </VectorP>\n          <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\", margin: \"6rem 0 0.5rem 0\" }}>\n            <Image style={{ margin: \"0\" }} src={VectorArticle_8} id=\"\" />\n          </div>\n          <VectorCaption\n            style={{ textAlign: \"center\", marginBottom: \"2.5rem\" }}\n          >\n            Phase one of the interactive activities page.\n          </VectorCaption>\n          <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\", marginBottom: \"0.5rem\" }}>\n            <Image style={{ margin: \"0\" }} src={VectorArticle_9} id=\"\" />\n          </div>\n          <VectorCaption\n            style={{ textAlign: \"center\", marginBottom: \"2.5rem\" }}\n          >\n            Finalized interactive activities page and menu bar design.\n          </VectorCaption>\n          <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\", marginBottom: \"0.5rem\" }}>\n            <Image style={{ margin: \"0\" }} src={VectorArticle_100} id=\"\" />\n          </div>\n          <VectorCaption\n            style={{ textAlign: \"center\", marginBottom: \"2.5rem\" }}\n          >\n            Finalized remainning page design.\n          </VectorCaption>\n          <VectorGridHalf>\n            <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n              <ImageGrid\n                style={{ maxWidth: \"100%\", margin: \"0 0 0.5rem 0\" }}\n                src={VectorArticle_10}\n                id=\"\"\n              />\n            </div>\n            <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n              <ImageGrid\n                style={{ maxWidth: \"100%\", margin: \"0 0 0.5rem 0\" }}\n                src={VectorArticle_11}\n                id=\"\"\n              />\n            </div>\n          </VectorGridHalf>\n          <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\", marginBottom: \"2rem\" }}>\n            <Image\n              style={{ margin: \"0\", maxWidth: \"40%\" }}\n              src={VectorArticle_101}\n              id=\"\"\n            />\n          </div>\n          <VectorCaption style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n            Finalized brochure design.\n          </VectorCaption>\n          <VectorH1>The outcome</VectorH1>\n          <VectorP>\n            Through this project, I have found out challenges gradually on each\n            stage and developed and designed the website to a stage that was\n            functional and valuable.\n          </VectorP>\n          <VectorP style={{ marginTop: \"1.5rem\" }}>\n            Looking back at it now I can surely say it's been quite a ride.

The effort and sacrifices that\n            are required to send off a product into the world were beyond my\n            expectations. However, once the product lets it dive into the world\n            and turn into “alive” is the time when the real journey actually\n            launches.
