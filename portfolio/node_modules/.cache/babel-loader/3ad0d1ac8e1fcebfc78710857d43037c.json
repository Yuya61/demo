Therefore, I was\n            responsible for building each section of the project, designing it\n            for different devices, managing the timeline, giving detailed\n            instructions to each developer, and overseeing the whole process.\n          </VectorP>\n          <VectorP style={{ marginTop: \"1.5rem\" }}>\n            For those who are unaware of Parkinson's disease, it will only be\n            perceived as the name of the disease. But it wouldn't seem like a\n            very mild illness to strangers. Vector thought he would give hope\n            and courage to other patients based on his years of fighting\n            experience. In order to convey this feeling to the website, it is\n            necessary to firmly build the Vector brand to have a strong message\n            to end-users with design, attractive and consistent branding that is\n            not found on general medical sites. And I was convinced that the\n            achievement was the goal of this project.\n          </VectorP>\n          <VectorP style={{ marginTop: \"1.5rem\" }}>\n            This way we could also achieve a more consistent user experience\n            across the different end-users.\n          </VectorP>\n          <VectorP style={{ marginTop: \"1.5rem\" }}>\n            Design methods used during the project included journey mapping,\n            UI/UX design, and prototyping solutions. During the project, I also\n            designed features needed for a wider launch.\n          </VectorP>\n          {/* <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n            <Image src={VectorArticle_3} id=\"3\" />\n            <Image style={{ margin: \"0\" }} src={VectorArticle_4} id=\"4\" />\n          </div> */}\n          <VectorP style={{ marginTop: \"5rem\" }}>\n            Design and developer collaboration is a most challenging problem and\n            there are many opportunities how to sync each other. All of design\n            tooling that exists today isn't enforcing that behavior. All they do\n            is attempt to do similar things. Unless design to development all\n            share the same settings or agreed on setting, there is no real\n            \"bridge” between developers and designers.\n          </VectorP>\n          {/* <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n            <Image src={VectorArticle_5} id=\"5\" />\n          </div> */}\n          <VectorP>\n            While some developers were inexperienced, it was a uneasy to proceed\n            with the project in a limited time to convey the first instruction\n            with the design tool. In order to get a better understanding of the\n            design, I created it myself without using XD only at the beginning.\n          </VectorP>\n          <VectorP style={{ marginTop: \"1.5rem\" }}>\n            After a few meetings with Vector, I saw what he really needed, so I\n            decided to create a landing page and homepage to implement it\n            concretely. The most important thing in doing so was to create a\n            consistent design to get the most out of his brand.\n          </VectorP>\n          {/* <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n            <Image src={VectorArticle_6} id=\"6\" />\n          </div> */}\n          <VectorP style={{ marginTop: \"1.5rem\" }}>\n            After a few meetings with Vector, I saw what he really needed, so I\n            decided to create a landing page and homepage to implement it\n            concretely.

It's a problem with\n            every project, regardless of language or culture, but the challenge\n            is how to deal with it.
