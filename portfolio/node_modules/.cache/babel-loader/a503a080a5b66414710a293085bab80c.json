I approached to do design to secure what clients propose.\n            Aesthetically minimal, simple, clean, and move ahead at a fast pace,\n            those things were the highest priority for this project. First of\n            all, as a result of those requirements, I thought to \"React\" was the\n            most fits library for this project in terms of overall sights\n            multi-directionally. from sights of trend (but not only reason for\n            trend, React has several logical advantages), end-users who will\n            have feelings that loading speed speedily, and my proficiency this\n            language. And, I also have chosen \"React Bootstrap\" as a reliable\n            framework that will be able to address those pain points for quick\n            development mainly to achieve a consistent design.\n          </DarumaP>\n          <DarumaH1 style={{ marginTop: \"5rem\" }}>Final thoughts</DarumaH1>\n          <DarumaP>\n            While I was in this project, it has become clear about few issues\n            about mainly by Bootstrup.

I wouldn't see it was\n            just problems. I would like to it became productive, future issues.\n            I had to create an efficient configuration that in order to the\n            possibility for something happen future carefully.
