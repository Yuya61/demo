one website. Previously web site had had very\n            ancient designs and services which made it harder to utilize\n            synergies between services by design and ultimately made it\n            difficult for customers to find the relevant information to them.\n          </DarumaP>\n          <DarumaP style={{ marginTop: \"1.5rem\" }}>\n            They had that those painful therefore Daruma asked me to create a\n            renovated website have through my connection.\n          </DarumaP>\n          <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n            <Image src={DarumaArticle_2} id=\"\" />\n          </div>\n          <DarumaH1>The Goal</DarumaH1>\n          <DarumaP>\n            The primary website idea is to allow users to easily create, share.\n            Whether it immediately needs to reserve or just a night out with\n            someone in this restaurant. There are many similar websites already\n            on the market, however, most of them provide very complexly and\n            similar.\n          </DarumaP>\n          <DarumaP style={{ marginTop: \"1.5rem\" }}>\n            The restaurant's main requirement has always been to keep the\n            website usable, reliable, and functional. Aesthetically minimal,\n            simple, and clean. There are no ads and also no tricks, but there is\n            a consistent and intuitive user experience, providing value to our\n            users, keeping them satisfied and engaged. And the client wanted to\n            me create the website quickly.\n          </DarumaP>\n          <DarumaH1 style={{ marginTop: \"5rem\" }}>My role</DarumaH1>\n          <DarumaP>\n            I worked on this project as a UI/UX designer and developer as well.\n            In addition to those, I gave input regarding the as an adviser for\n            all of the website and I have in charge of that position as an\n            administrator for this website.\n          </DarumaP>\n          <DarumaH1 style={{ marginTop: \"5rem\" }}>Challenge</DarumaH1>\n          <DarumaP>\n            As outlined above, I have had to everything to design and develop\n            for this project with my own skills, so that it was the most\n            significant requirement to give this finalized product as soon as\n            possible by following the client proposed demand.\n          </DarumaP>\n          <DarumaH1 style={{ marginTop: \"5rem\" }}>Solution</DarumaH1>\n          <DarumaP>\n            It was necessary to consider both of these perspectives about\n            designer and developer are notable points and I wanted to treat both\n            they deserve. And I have felt that is important to keep both\n            perspectives in careful consideration before decided to dive into\n            coding. I approached to do design to secure what clients propose.\n            Aesthetically minimal, simple, clean, and move ahead at a fast pace,\n            those things were the highest priority for this project. First of\n            all, as a result of those requirements, I thought to \"React\" was the\n            most fits library for this project in terms of overall sights\n            multi-directionally. from sights of trend (but not only reason for\n            trend, React has several logical advantages), end-users who will\n            have feelings that loading speed speedily, and my proficiency this\n            language. And, I also have chosen \"React Bootstrap\" as a reliable\n            framework that will be able to address those pain points for quick\n            development mainly to achieve a consistent design.\n          </DarumaP>\n          <DarumaH1 style={{ marginTop: \"5rem\" }}>Final thoughts</DarumaH1>\n          <DarumaP></DarumaP>\n          <DarumaH1>The outcome</DarumaH1>\n          <DarumaP></DarumaP>\n        </DarumaWrapper>\n      </motion.div>\n    </DarumaContainer>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Article_Daruma;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
