I have felt that it is important to keep both\n            perspectives in careful consideration before deciding to dive into\n            coding. I approached to do design to secure what clients proposed.\n            Aesthetically minimal, simple, clean, and move ahead at a fast pace,\n            those things were the highest priority for this project. First of\n            all, as a result of those requirements, I thought \"React\" was the\n            best fitting library for this project in terms of overall sights\n            multi-directionally. From sights of trend (but not only reason for\n            trend, React has several logical advantages), end-users who will\n            have feelings that loading speed is fast, and because of my\n            proficiency in this language. And, I also have chosen \"React\n            Bootstrap\" as a reliable framework that will be able to address\n            those pain points for quick development mainly to achieve a\n            consistent design.\n          </DarumaP>\n          <DarumaH1 style={{ marginTop: \"5rem\" }}>Final thoughts</DarumaH1>\n          <DarumaP>\n            While I was in this project, few issues have become clear about\n            Bootstrap. That framework wasn't flexible\n            more than I have imagined, I will address future issues and problems\n            from the standpoint of circumstances of this project. I wouldn't see\n            it as just problems, I would like it became productive, future\n            issues. I had to create an efficient configuration that in order to\n            the possibility for something happen future carefully. Especially if\n            I have to involve the project longer.

In my opinion, Yuya is a hard-working\n              self-starter who invariably understands exactly what a project is\n              all about. That those skills were required especially in this\n              project. Our thoughts of the previous website were had had old\n              fashion style. So that we couldn't understand about why have to\n              renovate it until gets complain about ours, regular customers. But\n              we couldn't much spend money to renovate for a new web site. I was\n              just about to start to search how do I find the proper person and,\n              my coworker found out dependable web specialist among a lot of\n              candidate in IT industry, I was asking him to helps to find the\n              opportunity. There was no room for discussion to hire him for our\n              project. He consistently produced high-quality work in a timely\n              fashion so far invariably. After started the project with him,\n              first of all, We have made meetings frequently to reduce pain\n              points for the future. It was a necessary thing because we\n              couldn't invest much in this project so that, we had to reduce the\n              possibility generate misunderstandings for each other to avoid\n              modifying after finalized. The only area of weakness that I ever\n              noted in Yuya’s performance was If I have to choose a word, should\n              have proposed a little bit more about prototypes. But I know it\n              seems impossible in terms of this project term and his heavy\n              workload. And I trust that he will tweak for each deferent works.\n              I so much respect Yuya's attitude toward his work. so that, I am\n              therefore very pleased to be able to recommend Yuya for future\n              one's positions.\n            </DarumaP>\n          </Feedback>\n          {/* feedback section */}\n        </DarumaWrapper>\n      </motion.div>\n    </DarumaContainer>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Article_Daruma;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
