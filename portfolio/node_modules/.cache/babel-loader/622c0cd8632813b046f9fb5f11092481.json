   <LarryP>\n            Larry had just published a book about Parkin's disease, which he\n            also suffers from, and was trying to create a website to spread the\n            book around the world. He then contacted the school through Ribpen\n            and started the project with us because he met the final project\n            recruitment requirements.\n          </LarryP>\n          <LarryP style={{ marginTop: \"1.5rem\" }}>\n            We divided into four groups and competed for Larry's trust. And I\n            was in charge of all the first stage presentations, and I was\n            selected from four groups and succeeded in winning his trust.\n          </LarryP>\n          <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n            <Image src={LarryArticle_2} id=\"\" />\n          </div>\n          <LarryH1>My role</LarryH1>\n          <LarryP>\n            I worked on the project as a UI/UX designer, together with a and the\n            development team.\n          </LarryP>\n          <LarryP>\n            The image above is the first prototype that I first proposed and\n            gained credibility.\n          </LarryP>\n          <LarryH1 style={{ marginTop: \"5rem\" }}>Challenge</LarryH1>\n          <LarryP>\n            The intention of having a home page was certainly to make money for\n            books, but another intention was to share his own experience and\n            knowledge. One of the reasons he decided to create a site was\n            because he wanted to convey his own words to other Parkinson's\n            patients on the website. He already has his own blog, and it was\n            also a question of how his blog would appear on the website.\n          </LarryP>\n          <LarryH1 style={{ marginTop: \"5rem\" }}>Solution</LarryH1>\n          <LarryP>\n            My first job when this project started was to guide the team on the\n            best path towards the goals of the project. Therefore, I was\n            responsible for building each section of the project, designing it\n            for different devices, managing the timeline, giving detailed\n            instructions to each developer, and overseeing the whole process.\n          </LarryP>\n          <LarryP style={{ marginTop: \"1.5rem\" }}>\n            For those who are unaware of Parkinson's disease, it will only be\n            perceived as the name of the disease. But it wouldn't seem like a\n            very mild illness to strangers. Larry thought he would give hope and\n            courage to other patients based on his years of fighting experience.\n            In order to convey this feeling to the website, it is necessary to\n            firmly build the Larry brand to have a strong message to end-users\n            with design, attractive and consistent branding that is not found on\n            general medical sites. And I was convinced that the achievement was\n            the goal of this project.\n          </LarryP>\n          <LarryP style={{ marginTop: \"1.5rem\" }}>\n            This way we could also achieve a more consistent user experience\n            across the different end-users.\n          </LarryP>\n          <LarryP style={{ marginTop: \"1.5rem\" }}>\n            Design methods used during the project included journey mapping,\n            UI/UX design, and prototyping solutions. During the project, I also\n            designed features needed for a wider launch.\n          </LarryP>\n          <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n            <Image src={LarryArticle_3} id=\"\" />\n            <Image style={{ margin: \"0\" }} src={LarryArticle_4} id=\"\" />\n          </div>\n          <LarryP style={{ marginTop: \"5rem\" }}>\n            Design and developer collaboration is a most challenging problem and\n            there are many opportunities how to sync each other. All of design\n            tooling that exists today isn't enforcing that behavior. All they do\n            is attempt to do similar things. Unless design to development all\n            share the same settings or agreed on setting, there is no real\n            \"bridge” between developers and designers.\n          </LarryP>\n          <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n            <Image src={LarryArticle_5} id=\"\" />\n          </div>\n          <LarryP>\n            While some developers were inexperienced, it was a uneasy to proceed\n            with the project in a limited time to convey the first instruction\n            with the design tool. In order to get a better understanding of the\n            design, I created it myself without using XD only at the beginning.\n          </LarryP>\n          <LarryP style={{ marginTop: \"1.5rem\" }}>\n            After a few meetings with Larry, I saw what he really needed, so I\n            decided to create a landing page and homepage to implement it\n            concretely. The most important thing in doing so was to create a\n            consistent design to get the most out of his brand.\n          </LarryP>\n          <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n            <Image src={LarryArticle_6} id=\"\" />\n          </div>\n          <LarryP style={{ marginTop: \"1.5rem\" }}>\n            After a few meetings with Larry, I saw what he really needed, so I\n            decided to create a landing page and homepage to implement it\n            concretely.

It's a problem with\n            every project, regardless of language or culture, but the challenge\n            is how to deal with it.

At first, it was a key to create\n            individual blog article pages on the homepage, but since Larry\n            wanted to make the system simple to update and edit, end-users can\n            touch the outline of the article and assist clicking.
